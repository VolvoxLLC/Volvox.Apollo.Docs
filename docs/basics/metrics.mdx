# Metrics

The Analyze API endpoint in the Volvox.Apollo suite processes an input and then produces a collection of modles.
Each model is accompanied by a score that quantifies its relevance to the input.
Scores range from 0 to 100, where a score of 100 signifies an exact match with the ideal model profile.
This scoring system assists users in identifying the most suitable model by providing a clear, numerical measure of compatibility.
