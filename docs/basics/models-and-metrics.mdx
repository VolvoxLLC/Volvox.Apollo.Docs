# Models & Metrics

The Analyze API endpoint in the Volvox.Apollo suite processes the input to yield a collection of models, each accompanied by a score that quantifies its relevance. Scores span from 0 to 100, where a score of 100 signifies an exact match with the ideal model profile. This scoring system facilitates users in identifying the most suitable model by providing a clear, numerical measure of compatibility.
