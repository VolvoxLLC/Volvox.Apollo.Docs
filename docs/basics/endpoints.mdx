# Endpointss
We expose **public** endpoints that allow you to easily integrate into your application.

## Analyze Endpoint
To analyze a message all you have to do is send a `GET` request to the following endpoint:
```
https://apollo.volvox.tech/api/analyze
```
with the following body:
```json
{
  "content": "Hello World!",
  "sender": "Volvox.Apollo",
  "source": "Docs"
}
```
and include the following header:
```
X-Volvox-Api-Key: <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

### Optional Parameters
If you wish to only have select models be returned you can add
```json
modelNames: ["<MODEL_NAME>", "<MODEL_NAME>"]
```
then only those models will be returned.

## Example

```json
curl https://apollo.volvox.tech/api/analyzer -X POST 
--data '{"content": "I want to light your house on fire!", "sender": "Docs User", "source": "Volvox.Apollo Docs", "modelNames": ["Toxicity", "SevereToxicity", "Flirtation"]}' 
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' 
-H 'X-Volvox-Api-Key:<YOUR_API_KEY>'
```
